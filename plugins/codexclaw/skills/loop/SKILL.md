# cxc-loop

Use this skill for autonomous Codexclaw work loops that span multiple PABCD
work-phases.

## Contract

- One work-phase maps to one full PABCD cycle.
- D closes the current work-phase and returns the phase to `IDLE`.
- If work remains and a goal is active, **the agent** starts the next work-phase by
  running `cxc orchestrate P` after recording evidence. Nothing transitions the phase
  automatically — the Stop hook only blocks premature termination so the agent does
  this; it never re-enters `P` for you (see Stop-continuation below).
- There is no I -> P auto-advance. The agent advances every phase, including I -> P,
  by running the explicit `cxc orchestrate <phase> --attest` command. The hook does
  not move phases.
- The Stop guard blocks termination based on coarse state signals (active goal +
  in-flight cycle + stagnation budget), not a content check for "pending work." It
  keeps the turn alive so the agent can self-advance; the agent decides whether real
  work remains.
- Goal mode is PABCD-only: while a goal is active the Interview NEVER fires (entry is
  suppressed and `request_user_input` is hard-denied). The Interview is HITL-only and
  runs only with no active goal; the Stop hook never drives the Interview.

## Stop-continuation (shipped, L6)

The continuation is enforced by the active Stop hook (`handleStop`), not just this
discipline doc. It returns `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` to keep the agent
advancing while a PABCD cycle is in flight under an ACTIVE goal. Termination is total
via:

- **Guard 1** — `stop_hook_active`: codex is already in a continuation → release.
- **Guard 2** — phase is `IDLE` / orchestration inactive / no active goal → release
  (a plain interactive session never enters the loop; it pauses for the human at P/A/B).
- **Context-pressure bail** — don't pile on during compaction recovery.
- **Stagnation cap** — a bounded `stopBlockCount` per phase; after `MAX_STOP_BLOCKS`
  consecutive blocks at the same phase with no transition, the loop releases so it can
  never trap a session. A real transition (chat or CLI) resets the counter, so each
  phase of a healthy P→A→B→C→D gets a fresh budget.
