# codexclaw

cli-jaw-style development discipline and multi-model subagents for the **OpenAI Codex runtime**, packaged as a single Codex plugin.

codexclaw does **not** ship its own agent harness. It reuses the `codex` runtime and layers on top:

- **dev skills** — the cli-jaw `dev-*` family normalized to Codex `SKILL.md` convention (project-agnostic discipline: architecture, debugging, testing, review, security, ...).
- **PABCD workflow** — Plan / Audit / Build / Check / Done, reimplemented as Codex-native skills + hooks + file state (no external orchestrator server).
- **multi-model subagents** — role-based subagents (explorer / reviewer / executor) that can run on the default model or different models.
- **optional opencodex (ocx) provider bridge** — when `ocx` is installed, codexclaw routes multi-provider model selection through it. When it is not, codexclaw degrades gracefully and everything else still works.

```

## Install (target flow)

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lidge-jun/codexclaw
codex plugin add codexclaw@personal
```

## GUI

The codexclaw GUI handles subagent configuration (default model vs multi-model), prompt tuning, and — when `ocx` is detected — a link bar to the opencodex dashboard at `localhost:10100`.

## Status

MVP core is implemented and the `mvp_hard` L2-L8 parity hardening track is active:
`cxc orchestrate` is live, chat-side phase control writes the same `.codexclaw/` state,
the IPABCD footer/status affordance is wired, and the Stop-continuation loop runs under
an active Codex goal with a bounded stagnation guard. See `devlog/_plan/` for the shipped
ledger and remaining hardening slices.
